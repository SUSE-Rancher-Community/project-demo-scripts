# Installing with Shared Dependencies

## Description

This will walk a user through the installing a chart using Hypper.

## Steps

To install a chart using `hypper` the command is very similar to `helm`:

```bash
hypper install demo/demo
```

The output will look like the following:

```bash
demo v1.0.0
 ‚îú‚îÄ demo-a v1.0.0
 ‚îî‚îÄ demo-b v1.0.0
    ‚îî‚îÄ demo-c v1.0.0

üõ≥  Installing chart "demo-a" as "demo-a" in namespace "demo-a"‚Ä¶
üõ≥  Installing chart "demo-c" as "demo-c" in namespace "demo-c"‚Ä¶
üõ≥  Installing chart "demo-b" as "demo-b" in namespace "demo-b"‚Ä¶
üõ≥  Installing chart "demo" as "demoit" in namespace "demo"‚Ä¶
üëè Done!
```

This will give you a dependency diagram to show you what is dependent on what.

This will also output each installation.

If we look at the output we can see that `demo-b` is dependent on `demo-c` we can look at this deeper by using the following command:

```bash
helm show chart demo/demo-b
```

This output looks like this:

```bash
annotations:
  hypper.cattle.io/namespace: demo-b
  hypper.cattle.io/release-name: demo-b
  hypper.cattle.io/shared-dependencies: |
    - name: demo-c
      version: "^1.0.0"
      repository: "https://mattfarina.github.io/demo-hypper-charts/repo"
apiVersion: v2
appVersion: 1.16.0
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes
name: demo-b
type: application
version: 1.0.0
```

We can then see that there is a shared dependencies in `demo-b` that shows it is dependent on `demo-c`.

Lastly we can see what all was installed with using the following command:

```bash
hypper ls -A
```

And what we will get is a list of what was installed that will match the installation output we looked at earlier:

```bash
